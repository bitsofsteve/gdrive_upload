# gdrive_upload
This repository holds a simple script for interfacing with the Google drive API ( Folder Creation and File Upload)


### Pre-requisite
The script requires the Google Drive API key to be available as a ```credentials.json``` in the top level directory
You can see how to setup this API key via https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api

### Setup
- After cloning the code , change directory into the cloned directory

- Create a virtual environment by running ``` python3 -m venv env ``` in the directory

- Activate the virtual environment by running ``` source env/bin/activate ```

- Install the code dependencies by running ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
